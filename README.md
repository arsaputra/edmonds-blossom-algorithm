# Edmonds' Blossom Algorithm
## About
This is a python implementation of Edmonds' Blossom Algoirhtm to find a maximal-cardinality matching in a given simple graph. This was a programming exercise on the module 'Discrete Optimization (ADM II)' held by Prof. Dr. Martin Skutella at TU Berlin in summer semester 2020. I did this project together with a partner. We did this project using the pair programming paradigm, where i mainly think about the implementation and the debugging while my partner mostly think about the mathematical interpretation. Even though the running time is not guaranteed to be optimal, the code's correctness has been verified by the teaching assistant. The implementation is based on “Maximum Matchings.” Combinatorial Optimization, by Bernhard Korte and Jens Vygen, 2nd ed., Springer, 2002, pp. 219–225.
